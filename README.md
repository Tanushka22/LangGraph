# LangGraph
LangGraph-based Conversational AI Project
Tech Stack: Python, LangChain, LangGraph, OpenAI API, Tavily, NetworkX, Streamlit

Designed and implemented a conversational AI agent using LangGraph, enabling multi-step AI workflows with graph-based structures.

Integrated Tavily for real-time web search, enhancing the AIâ€™s ability to retrieve up-to-date and relevant information dynamically.

Developed a dynamic agent architecture supporting multiple paths and conditional decision-making in conversations.

Utilized LangChain with OpenAI API for context-aware response generation and advanced reasoning.

Constructed conversation flows using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to enable stateful and flexible interactions.

Optimized agent performance with state management techniques, improving scalability and response efficiency.

Deployed the application using Streamlit, enabling real-time interaction and evaluation of AI-driven dialogues.
